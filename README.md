etch-android
============
Android client source code for the [Etch app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kurtome.etch.app),
which is a prototype for an augmented reality experience for digital graffiti on top of Goggle Maps. All users
of the app draw in on the same world canvas (drawings are saved to cloud storage).
